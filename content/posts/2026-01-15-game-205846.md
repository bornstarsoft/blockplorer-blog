In a surprising twist, indie developer Petter Malmehed has linked the decline of his puzzle game, After Hours, on Steam to a generational gap in email communication skills. As reviews for his game dropped, Malmehed discovered that many young players were misunderstanding the essential mechanics of the game, which required them to send real-life emails to progress. The culprit? A significant number of these emails were missing content in the body, with everything crammed into the subject line, rendering the in-game system ineffective.

Malmehed's observations raise an intriguing question about how modern communication methods are shaping the gaming experience. With the rise of instant messaging and social media, traditional email etiquette seems to be fading, leaving younger players at a disadvantage when faced with games that require more complex forms of interaction. This disconnect not only affects gameplay but also highlights a broader trend in how we communicate in the digital age.

As developers like Malmehed adapt to these changes, it will be interesting to see how future games evolve to accommodate new communication styles. Will we see more games that simplify their mechanics to align with the preferences of younger audiences, or will there be a resurgence of nostalgia-driven titles that challenge players to engage in more traditional forms of communication? The future of gaming may very well depend on the answers to these questions.

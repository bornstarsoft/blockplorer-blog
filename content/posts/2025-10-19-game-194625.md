After two decades of anticipation, the legendary Infinity on Game Boy Color is set to make its triumphant return in Q4 of 2025. This tactical RPG, originally developed by Affinix Software, was tragically canceled in 2002 but has now been revived by Incube8 Games, thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign. With its unique strategic battle system and immersive storyline, Infinity promises to be a nostalgic yet fresh experience for both old fans and new players alike.

The game features a rich narrative where an ancient evil threatens two rival nations, and players will navigate through over 30 explorable areas with five playable characters. The stunning 8-bit graphics and over 100 items to collect will surely captivate retro gaming enthusiasts. Pre-orders are now available, including a collector's edition packed with exclusive goodies. Will you be among the first to dive back into this classic world?

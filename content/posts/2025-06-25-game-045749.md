Linking **Metroid Zero Mission** to **Metroid Fusion** is not just a nostalgic nod to the past; it’s a gateway to unlocking a hidden treasure for fans of the series. By connecting these two iconic titles via a link cable and holding down START + SELECT while booting up Fusion, players can access the exclusive Metroid Fusion picture gallery in Zero Mission. This clever feature adds a layer of interactivity that enhances the gaming experience, making it a must-try for any Metroid enthusiast.

For those playing on the Nintendo Switch, the good news is that the Fusion Gallery is already unlocked by default in the Switch Online version of Metroid Zero Mission through the GBA app, provided you have the Expansion Pack. This makes it easier than ever for new players to dive into the rich lore and stunning visuals of the Metroid universe.

As gaming technology continues to evolve, it’s exciting to see how developers like Nintendo integrate classic features into modern platforms. What other hidden gems might be waiting for discovery in your favorite retro games?

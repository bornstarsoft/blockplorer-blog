Gamirror Games is set to launch AiliA, a captivating visual mirror-based puzzle game, on January 9, 2026. This unique 3D puzzle-adventure invites players to step into the shoes of Aria, a young girl navigating a world where reality and its mirrored counterpart intertwine. The core gameplay mechanics revolve around manipulating mirrors to reshape the environment, allowing players to explore and solve over 100 intricate puzzles.

What sets AiliA apart is its stunning Eastern aesthetic and the tangible nature of its mirrored world. Players can walk on reflected pathways, activate mechanisms, and interact with characters, all while unraveling the layered mysteries hidden within the mirrors. With seven visually distinct stages and additional hidden levels, AiliA promises to challenge both your spatial awareness and creative thinking skills.

As the release date approaches, gamers can already experience a playable demo on Steam. Will AiliA redefine how we perceive puzzle games? Only time will tell, but it certainly has the potential to captivate audiences with its innovative gameplay and artistic design.

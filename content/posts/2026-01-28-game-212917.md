Highguard, the newly launched free-to-play shooter, has made waves in the gaming community by attracting nearly 100,000 concurrent players on its launch day. However, this impressive player count is overshadowed by a staggering 13,000 negative reviews on Steam, raising questions about the game's reception and future.

Despite the excitement surrounding its announcement at The Game Awards, where it was the final reveal, players have expressed dissatisfaction primarily due to the game's large map size, which many feel is ill-suited for its 3vs3 matchups. With only 32.05% of reviews being positive, it seems that while Highguard has captured initial attention, sustaining player interest will be a challenge for developer Wildlight Entertainment.

As the team behind Highguard includes veterans from popular franchises like Apex Legends and Call of Duty, fans are left wondering how the game will evolve in response to player feedback. Will the developers address these concerns and turn the tide of public opinion, or will Highguard struggle to maintain its player base? Only time will tell.

In a surprising turn of events, Romero Games has publicly denied reports of its closure, despite facing significant challenges after losing funding for its unannounced first-person shooter project. The studio, founded by gaming legends John and Brenda Romero, has stated that it is actively exploring new publishing opportunities to revive its project, which was abruptly canceled after a deal with Microsoft fell through.

The studio's recent statement emphasizes that it is not shutting down and has received interest from several publishers willing to help bring the game to completion. This news comes on the heels of widespread layoffs at Microsoft, which could affect thousands of employees. Romero Games is currently reassessing its staffing and future plans, aiming to navigate through this turbulent period.

As the gaming community rallies behind Romero Games, one can't help but wonder: will this studio rise from the ashes and deliver a groundbreaking title, or is this the beginning of the end for yet another promising project? Stay tuned for updates as the situation unfolds.

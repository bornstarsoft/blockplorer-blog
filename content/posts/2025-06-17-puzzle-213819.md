In a recent announcement, Gearbox has confirmed that the highly anticipated Borderlands 4 will retail for $70 for its standard edition, putting to rest concerns about a potential $80 price tag. This decision comes after Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford faced backlash for suggesting that "real fans" would find a way to pay more. The confirmation of a $70 price point is a relief for many gamers who were worried about the rising costs of new titles.

Alongside the standard edition, Gearbox is also offering a $130 Super Deluxe Edition and a $150 Collectorâ€™s Edition, which intriguingly does not include the game itself. Fans can look forward to post-launch content, including new characters, regions, and story missions, with more details set to be revealed later. This approach indicates Gearbox's commitment to providing value beyond the initial purchase, which is crucial in today's competitive gaming landscape.

As we gear up for the release on September 12, 2025, and the subsequent launch on Nintendo Switch 2, it's clear that Gearbox is aiming to strike a balance between quality and affordability. Will this pricing strategy set a new standard for future game releases? Only time will tell.

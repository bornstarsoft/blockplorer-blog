Square Enix's recent video showcasing the comparison of Final Fantasy 7 Remake across the Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC has sparked significant interest among gamers. What stands out is how the Switch 2, despite its lower power, manages to deliver impressive visual quality that rivals its more powerful counterparts. This is particularly noteworthy as it highlights the advancements in optimization techniques that can allow a less powerful console to shine in a competitive landscape.

The video, while running at a stable 30 frames per second, demonstrates that the differences in graphical fidelity are subtle, with lighting being a key factor in maintaining the game's immersive atmosphere. Director Naoki Hamaguchi emphasized that preserving lighting quality was crucial to avoid compromising the game's visual integrity. This approach has resulted in a version that, while capped at 30fps, still looks graphically detailed and engaging on the Switch 2.

As we look forward to the release of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on January 22, it raises an intriguing question: Can the Switch 2 continue to hold its own against more powerful consoles in the future?

In the world of game development, the term "ghost developer" often refers to companies like Tose, which work behind the scenes on major titles without receiving public credit. Recent financial disclosures reveal that Tose's biggest clients in the past year were none other than Atlus and Square Enix, highlighting the critical role these partnerships play in the gaming industry. Atlus alone accounted for an impressive 22.3% of Tose's total revenue, solidifying its position as a key player in the market.

Tose, established in 1979, has a long history of collaborating with top-tier publishers such as Nintendo and Bandai Namco. Their recent projects, including the remakes of Dragon Quest I & II and Tales of Graces f, showcase their expertise and versatility across various gaming platforms. With Square Enix also significantly increasing its share of Toses revenue to 16.9%, it's clear that these collaborations are not just beneficial but essential for both parties.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, the importance of these behind-the-scenes partnerships will only grow. What does this mean for the future of game development, and how will Tose's role as a ghost developer shape the industry moving forward?

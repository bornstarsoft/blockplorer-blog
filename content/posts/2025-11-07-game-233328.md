In a significant turn of events, Bad Brain Game Studios, a subsidiary of NetEase, has announced its impending shutdown due to unsuccessful attempts to secure a new partner for its ambitious project, Midnight Riders. Set to cease operations on November 17th, 2025, this closure not only marks the end of a promising venture but also raises questions about the sustainability of game studios in an increasingly competitive landscape.

Studio head Sean Cooks expressed gratitude towards NetEase for their support during this challenging period, highlighting the extraordinary talent and passion of the team. Despite their efforts, the studio's journey has come to a close, leaving the underlying intellectual property available for acquisition or partnership. This situation echoes a broader trend within the gaming industry, where studios face mounting pressures to adapt and thrive amidst shifting market dynamics.

As we reflect on this development, it serves as a reminder of the challenges that lie ahead for game developers. Will we see a shift in how studios approach partnerships and project funding in the future?

Get ready for a fresh take on puzzle gaming with the upcoming release of 'ARROW WORLD' on Steam. This innovative real-time Sokoban puzzle game, developed by indie team ATOKESHI, challenges players to think on their feet as they guide the ever-moving cardboard box character, Hakoby, through a logistics warehouse. With a unique gameplay mechanic that emphasizes quick decision-making, 'ARROW WORLD' promises a thrilling experience that sets it apart from traditional puzzle games.

One of the standout features of 'ARROW WORLD' is its real-time gameplay, where players must continuously adapt their strategies as the environment changes. Unlike conventional Sokoban games that allow for careful planning, this title demands split-second judgments on when and where to place conveyor belts. The game also offers unlimited conveyor belt placement, encouraging creativity and strategic thinking while presenting the risk of creating obstacles for yourself later on.

With its visual design that transcends language barriers, 'ARROW WORLD' aims to reach a global audience, supporting 103 languages on Steam. As we approach the release date on February 27, 2026, it's exciting to think about how this game will redefine the puzzle genre and engage players worldwide. Will you be ready to tackle the challenges of 'ARROW WORLD'?

The gaming world is buzzing with excitement as Agni Flare Inc. announces the extension of the Steam Playtest for SHIKA-Q, an ultra-high-speed competitive puzzle game that has captivated players globally. Originally set to conclude on January 13, 2026, the Playtest period has now been extended until February 1, 2026, allowing even more gamers to dive into this thrilling experience.

SHIKA-Q redefines the puzzle genre with its real-time competitive mechanics, where players engage in fast-paced battles on a 1010 board. Unlike traditional puzzle games, SHIKA-Q emphasizes strategy and split-second decision-making, making every match an exhilarating showdown. With modes like Offline Versus and a Challenge Mode that progresses players through intense levels, this game promises to keep players on the edge of their seats.

As we look forward to its full release, set for Winter 2026, one can't help but wonder how SHIKA-Q will shape the future of competitive gaming. Will it become a staple in esports? Only time will tell, but the potential is undeniably exciting.

As the gaming community eagerly anticipates the new titles coming to Xbox Game Pass, its crucial to remember that several beloved games are set to leave the service soon. On January 16, 2026, players will bid farewell to five notable titles: Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, Neon White, Road 96, The Ascent, and The Grinch: Christmas Adventures  Merry & Mischievous Edition. This is a reminder for subscribers to act quickly if they want to keep these games in their digital libraries.

Fortunately, Xbox provides a silver lining by offering discounts on games that are about to exit the subscription service. If youre a current subscriber, you can purchase these games at a reduced price before they disappear from the platform. This not only allows you to save some money but also ensures that you can continue enjoying these titles long after they leave the service.

With the clock ticking down to the departure of these games, it raises the question: what new titles will be introduced to replace them? As we await the next wave of announcements, its an exciting time for Xbox Game Pass subscribers. Will you be adding any of these games to your collection before theyre gone?

A new manga titled "Masahiro Sakurai: Making the World More Fun with Games" is set to release next month, offering fans an intimate look into the life of the legendary game designer behind iconic franchises like Kirby and Super Smash Bros. This 160-page biographical comic promises to delve into Sakurai's career, showcasing his journey from a young gamer to a celebrated creator, all while emphasizing his philosophy of sharing knowledge with the gaming community.

The manga is structured into six chapters, each highlighting pivotal moments in Sakurai's career, including the birth of Kirby and the founding of Sora, Inc. Notably, Sakurai himself supervised the project, ensuring that it reflects his genuine experiences and insights. This initiative aligns with his recent efforts to educate aspiring developers through his YouTube channel, where he shares invaluable lessons without monetizing his content.

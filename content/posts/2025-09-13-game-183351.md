The excitement around the next installment of the Super Mario Bros movie franchise has reached new heights, especially with the recent domain registrations hinting at a potential title: The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. This revelation stems from a photo shared on Reddit two months ago, showcasing limited edition Old Spice deodorant cans featuring beloved characters like Luigi and Yoshi, sparking speculation about the film's direction and themes.

While some initially dismissed the photo as a hoax, the recent domain registrations by NBCUniversal lend credibility to the idea that the next film may indeed be titled The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. This aligns with earlier hints from a press release that briefly mentioned a movie called Super Mario World, suggesting a strong connection to the galaxy theme. With the upcoming Nintendo Direct set to unveil more details, fans are eagerly awaiting confirmation.

As we gear up for the Nintendo Direct, which promises to deliver exciting news about upcoming Nintendo Switch games, the question remains: will we finally get official confirmation of the title and plot details for The Super Mario Bros Movie 2? Stay tuned!

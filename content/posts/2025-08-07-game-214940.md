In a significant move for the gaming community, MiHoYo has announced that support for the PS4 version of Genshin Impact will officially end in April 2026. This decision stems from the growing demands of the game, which have outstripped the hardware capabilities of the aging console. As the eighth console generation continues to fade, this announcement highlights the inevitable transition to more powerful gaming systems.

The shutdown will occur in three phases, starting with the removal of the game from the PlayStation Store on September 10, 2025. Following that, in-game purchases will be delisted by February 25, 2026, culminating in the cessation of all update support on April 8, 2026. Players who have previously downloaded the game will still have access, but new users will be unable to find it on the store.

While this news may be disappointing for PS4 players, MiHoYo assures that the PS5 version will continue to operate normally, allowing players to transition their progress seamlessly. As the gaming landscape evolves, how will players adapt to these changes, and what does this mean for the future of cross-platform gaming?

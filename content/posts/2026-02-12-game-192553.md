A recent study published in the journal Alzheimers & Dementia reveals that a specific type of brain training can significantly lower the risk of dementia, including Alzheimers disease. Over a 20-year period, researchers found that older adults who engaged in 14 to 22 hours of targeted brain exercises experienced a 25% reduction in their risk of being diagnosed with these debilitating conditions.

Doctor Michael Alosco from Boston Medical Center's neurology department emphasized the importance of these findings during an interview on Boston 25 News Now. This research not only highlights the potential of cognitive training but also opens up new avenues for preventative measures against dementia.

As we continue to explore the intersection of technology and health, could brain training become a staple in our daily routines to safeguard our cognitive health? Let's keep the conversation going and consider how we can incorporate these practices into our lives for a healthier future.

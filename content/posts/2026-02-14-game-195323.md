The 2026 Taipei International Game Show was a vibrant showcase of gaming culture, and the Dolls Frontline 2 booth stood out with its captivating cosplayers and interactive experiences. Fans flocked to meet their favorite characters, bringing the games universe to life in a way that only cosplay can.

At the Dolflo 2 booth, attendees were treated to a dazzling array of characters, from the cool and composed "Macchiato" to the playful "Suomi in swimsuit." The atmosphere was electric, with fans eagerly snapping photos alongside cosplayers, creating memorable moments that highlight the community's passion for the game. The inclusion of a Memory Puzzle Game added an interactive layer, encouraging players to engage more deeply with the app.

As we reflect on the success of the Dolflo 2 booth, its clear that events like these not only celebrate gaming but also foster connections among fans and creators alike. What other innovations do you think the gaming community will bring to future conventions?

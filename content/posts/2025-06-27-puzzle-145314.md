Capcom has unveiled an exciting glimpse into the future of gaming with its upcoming title, Pragmata, showcasing a unique blend of puzzle-solving and shooting mechanics. The recently released gameplay video reveals players will engage in hacking robots through intricate puzzle mini-games while simultaneously dodging and shooting at them. This innovative approach promises to elevate the action genre by integrating cerebral challenges into the fast-paced shooting experience.

Set in a near-future lunar research station in crisis, players take on the role of Hugh, a combat-ready spaceman, alongside his enigmatic android companion, Diana.

Having experienced a preview of Pragmata, early impressions suggest that the game is polished and leaves players eager for more. With Capcom's stellar track record in modern gaming, there’s a strong belief that Pragmata will deliver on its ambitious ideas. Will this innovative title redefine the puzzle-shooter genre?

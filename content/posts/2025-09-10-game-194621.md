AGNI-FLARE CO., LTD. has just announced the upcoming release of their innovative online competitive puzzle game, "SHIKA-Q," set to launch worldwide in Fall 2025.

The development team emphasizes that the fusion of strategy and musical dynamism is at the heart of SHIKA-Q. With a diverse music lineup and a focus on character and worldbuilding, this game promises to offer players not just a challenge, but a rich narrative experience as well.

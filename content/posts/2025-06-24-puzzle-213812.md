In a shocking turn of events, Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the much-anticipated game MindsEye, has reportedly initiated a mass layoff process that could affect over 100 employees. This decision comes on the heels of significant backlash regarding the game's technical issues, which have led to widespread player dissatisfaction and even refunds from PlayStationâ€”an action reminiscent of the infamous Cyberpunk 2077 launch.

The Edinburgh-based developer has begun a 45-day consultation period, as required by UK law when laying off 100 or more staff. With an estimated 300 employees in the UK and an additional 200 overseas, the studio's future appears uncertain, especially given the game's rocky release on June 10. The public's reaction has been overwhelmingly critical, with social media flooded with complaints about bugs and glitches that have marred the gaming experience.

In an apology issued earlier this month, the studio expressed its heartbreak over the situation and reiterated its commitment to improving player experiences. As the gaming community watches closely, one must wonder: what does this mean for the future of Build a Rocket Boy and its ambitious projects? Will they be able to recover from this setback, or will it mark a turning point in their journey?

In a surprising turn of events, the PS5 has welcomed a port of the 2021 Nintendo Switch exclusive, Worlds End Club, now available on the PS Store. This unexpected release follows a leak just two weeks prior, igniting excitement among fans of the action-adventure puzzle genre. However, its worth noting that there is no PS4 version available, which may leave some players disappointed.

Priced at $24.99, Worlds End Club offers a unique narrative crafted by the renowned Danganronpa creator, Kazutaka Kodaka. The game follows a group of Tokyo school children who find themselves trapped in an eerie underwater theme park after a bus accident. With its quirky characters and engaging storyline, this title promises to deliver an intriguing experience for both new players and returning fans alike.

Originally launched on Apple Arcade and later as a Switch exclusive, the transition to PS5 marks an exciting expansion for the game. As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, one can only wonder what other surprises await in the world of cross-platform releases. Will we see more exclusive titles making their way to different consoles in the future?

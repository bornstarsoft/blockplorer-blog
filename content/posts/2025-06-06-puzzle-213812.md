UnLoop, the upcoming Atompunk puzzle game from CM Games, is set to revolutionize the way we think about time manipulation in gaming. Slated for release on Quest and Pico this fall, this innovative title invites players to engage in a unique gameplay mechanic reminiscent of the critically acclaimed We Are One. By recording and stacking their actions, players can solve intricate puzzles while navigating a vibrant yet perilous space station known as the Temporal Research Hub.

As you infiltrate this well-guarded facility, the stakes are high. Players must dodge turrets and laser walls, often sacrificing themselves to progress through the game. The ability to throw objects and record voice memos adds layers of strategy, allowing for a more immersive experience. Each sector of the Atompunk map, from the Nexus Frame to the Asset Assembly Factory, introduces new chaos-inducing mechanics that challenge players to think creatively and adapt quickly.

With a PC VR port planned for a later date, UnLoop promises to deliver a fresh take on puzzle-solving that will captivate both casual gamers and hardcore enthusiasts alike. As we await its release, one can't help but wonder: how will this game shape the future of VR puzzle experiences?

Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, originally developed by Chris Oberth in 1991, is making a comeback thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This fully polished cartridge edition, priced at $100, not only revives a piece of gaming history but also supports the vital archival efforts of the VGHF. With an authentic NES cartridge and a detailed manual, this release highlights the challenges of preserving 8-bit history and the journey of Oberths career.

The resurrection of Xcavator serves as a reminder of the importance of preserving our digital heritage. As gaming enthusiasts, we often overlook the stories behind the games we love. This initiative not only brings a forgotten title back to life but also sheds light on the broader issues surrounding game preservation. Are we doing enough to ensure that future generations can experience the rich tapestry of gaming history?

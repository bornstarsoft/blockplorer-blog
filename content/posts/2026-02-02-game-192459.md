Highguard's recent launch has sparked a significant conversation in the gaming community, particularly around the importance of visibility for new titles. As Wildlight Entertainment's creative director Jason McCord pointed out, the key to success for a live service game is to "get eyeballs on your game." This insight underscores the challenges that new games face in a crowded market, where first impressions can make or break a title's future.

Despite a mixed reception at launch, Highguard has shown resilience, quickly addressing community feedback with a patch that enhances performance and introduces a highly anticipated 5v5 mode. This proactive approach not only helps to mend initial criticisms but also demonstrates Wildlight's commitment to engaging with its player base. In an era where gamers are increasingly vocal about their expectations, such responsiveness can be a game-changer.

As we look ahead, it will be fascinating to see if Highguard can transform its initial backlash into a thriving community. Will this game become a standout title in the live service genre, or will it fade into obscurity? Only time will tell, but the journey is certainly one to watch.

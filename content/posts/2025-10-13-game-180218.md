A recent listing for a Switch 2 version of Assassins Creed Shadows on a French retailer's website has sparked excitement among gamers. This development follows months of speculation since the game was first spotted on the PEGI site back in April. The listing not only includes box art but also hints at an innovative gaming experience tailored for the Nintendo Switch 2.

The anticipation for this port has been fueled by the successful release of Ubisoft's Star Wars Outlaws on the Switch 2, which has been praised for its impressive performance. With Assassins Creed Shadows reportedly offering a compelling narrative and expansive world, it seems poised to further enhance the Switch 2's library. As players eagerly await official confirmation, the question remains: will this port live up to the high expectations set by its predecessors?

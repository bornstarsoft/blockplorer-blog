Double Fine Productions has just announced Kiln, an innovative online multiplayer pottery party brawler that promises to reshape how we think about competitive gaming. In Kiln, players take on the role of a small spirit who must craft their own armor out of clay using a pottery wheel, allowing for a unique blend of creativity and strategy. This game not only emphasizes artistic expression but also introduces a dynamic combat system where players can customize their creations to suit their play style.

The game features a variety of gameplay options, including the exciting Quench mode, which pits teams of four against each other in fast-paced battles. With a plethora of customization optionsfrom the shape of your armor to the various abilities it can possessKiln aims to provide a fresh and engaging experience for players of all skill levels. As project lead Derek Brand noted, the goal is to make pottery accessible and fun, ensuring that everyone can feel like a master potter right from the start.

As we look forward to the official release later this year on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC, the anticipation builds for how players will embrace this unique blend of art and combat. Will Kiln redefine multiplayer gaming as we know it? Only time will tell.

In a recent interview, renowned Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu expressed his firm stance against using generative AI for music composition. Uematsu, who has crafted the iconic soundtracks for nearly every Final Fantasy game, believes that the true reward of music lies in the personal effort and struggle involved in its creation. He stated, "Ive never used it, and I probably never will," emphasizing the unique satisfaction derived from human creativity.

Uematsu also highlighted the importance of an artist's background in enhancing the listener's experience. He noted that part of the enjoyment of music comes from understanding the story behind its creation, something AI lacks. While he remains skeptical about AI's role in composition, he acknowledged its potential in other areas, such as managing audio transitions in games.

As the gaming industry evolves, the debate over AI's role in creative fields continues to grow. Will we see a future where human creativity and AI coexist harmoniously, or will traditional methods prevail? Only time will tell.

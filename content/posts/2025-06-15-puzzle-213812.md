Red Dead Redemption fans are buzzing with excitement as Rob Wiethoff, the actor behind the iconic character John Marston, has hinted at some thrilling news related to the franchise. During a recent livestream, Wiethoff teased that he has "exciting news" to share, which he suggests will be unveiled before the end of the week. This revelation comes amid swirling rumors about a current-generation version of Red Dead Redemption 2, potentially making its way to the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2.

The anticipation is palpable, especially with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick indicating that the publisher plans to support the Switch 2 more robustly than any previous Nintendo platform. With titles like Civilization VI and Borderlands 4 already lined up for launch, the addition of RDR2 could significantly enhance the console's appeal. Fans are left wondering what this news could entail and how it might reshape their gaming experience.

As we await further announcements, the excitement surrounding the Red Dead franchise continues to grow. Will we finally see John Marston's adventures on the latest gaming hardware? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the gaming community is ready for more Red Dead action.

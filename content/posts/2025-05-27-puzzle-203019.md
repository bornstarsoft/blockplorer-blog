In a bold move that has caught the attention of gamers worldwide, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This audacious statement not only highlights the developers' confidence but also taps into the nostalgia surrounding the beloved Portal franchise. With Valve's notorious reluctance to produce a third installment, ChromaGun 2 aims to fill that void, albeit with its unique twist on puzzle-solving mechanics.

While the game draws comparisons to Portal in terms of its setting—helping a company test new technology—the gameplay seems to align more closely with titles like Qube and Qube 2. Players will utilize a color-changing gun to manipulate objects, creating a vibrant and engaging puzzle experience. The original ChromaGun, released in 2016, garnered 'Mostly Positive' reviews, setting high expectations for its sequel. A free demo is available on Steam, allowing players to dive into this colorful world and see if it lives up to the legacy of its predecessors.

As we look forward to the release of ChromaGun 2, it raises an intriguing question: can indie developers successfully capture the magic of established franchises while carving out their own identity? Only time will tell, but for now, the excitement is palpable.

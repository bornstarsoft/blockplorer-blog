In a remarkable display of community spirit, a charity quiz has successfully raised over 2 million for Marie Curie over the past 18 years. This annual event, organized by the North East fundraising group of the charity, brings together teams from various backgrounds to compete in a fun and engaging quiz night, all while supporting a vital cause. The funds raised play a crucial role in providing care and support for individuals living with terminal illnesses and their families.

The quiz has become a staple in the local community, attracting participants of all ages and abilities. Last year alone, the event raised over 100,000, and the organizers are optimistic about surpassing that total this year. Its not just about the competition; its about coming together to make a difference in the lives of those who need it most. As the event continues to grow in popularity, it serves as a reminder of the power of community-driven initiatives in the tech-savvy world we live in today.

As we look forward to this years quiz, its inspiring to see how a simple idea can transform into a significant force for good. Will you join the movement and support such initiatives in your own community?

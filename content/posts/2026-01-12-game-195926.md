Stellar Blade studio Shift Up has made headlines once again by gifting its employees a remarkable package that includes cash bonuses and high-end Apple products. This generous gesture, which amounts to over $4,000 per employee, underscores the studio's commitment to rewarding talent and fostering a positive work environment. With a cash bonus of 5 million ($3,400), an Apple Watch, and AirPods Max, Shift Up is setting a high bar for employee appreciation in the gaming industry.

This isnt an isolated incident; Shift Up has a history of rewarding its staff for their hard work. From iPhone 14s to prepaid credit cards, the studio has consistently shown its dedication to its employees. Such initiatives not only boost morale but also help retain top talent in a competitive market. As the gaming industry continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how other companies respond to Shift Up's approach to employee rewards and whether they will adopt similar strategies to attract and retain talent.

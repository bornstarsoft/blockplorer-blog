In a daring move that echoes the legacy of one of gaming's most beloved franchises, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, *ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard*, boldly claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This statement not only captures the attention of fans of the original *Portal* series but also sets high expectations for a game that aims to fill the void left by Valve's reluctance to create a third installment.

While the game's aesthetics and narrative premise may draw parallels to *Portal*, the gameplay mechanics seem to take inspiration from other puzzle titles like *Qube*. Players will utilize a unique gun to manipulate colors and solve puzzles, creating a vibrant and engaging experience. The original *ChromaGun* received 'Mostly Positive' reviews upon its release in 2016, and this sequel promises to build on that foundation with fresh ideas and innovative gameplay.

For those eager to dive into this colorful world, a free demo is available on Steam, allowing players to experience the mechanics firsthand. As we look forward to the release of *ChromaGun 2*, one can't help but wonder: could this indie gem redefine the puzzle genre in the same way *Portal* did over a decade ago?
